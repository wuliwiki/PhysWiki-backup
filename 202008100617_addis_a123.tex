Free energy is arguably the most important property of molecular systems. Despite great progress in both its efficient estimation by scoring functions/potentials and more rigorous computation based on molecular simulations, we remain far from accurately predicting and manipulating biomolecular structures and their interactions. There are fundamental limitations, including accuracy of interaction description and difficulty of sampling in high dimensional space, to be tackled. Computational graph underlies major artificial intelligence platforms and is proved to facilitate training, optimization and learning. Combining autodifferentiation, coordinates transformation and generalized solvation free energy theory, we construct a computational graph infrastructure to realize seamless integration of fully trainable molecular interaction description with end to end differentiable free energy optimization. This new framework greatly improves efficiency by replacing local sampling with differentiation and is demonstrated in protein structure refinement.
