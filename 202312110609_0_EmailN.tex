\begin{itemize}
\item Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP): SMTP is used for sending and relaying outgoing emails. When you send an email, your email client uses SMTP to communicate with your email service's server, which in turn uses SMTP to send the email to the recipient's email server. SMTP typically operates over port 25, 587, or 465 (when using SSL/TLS).
