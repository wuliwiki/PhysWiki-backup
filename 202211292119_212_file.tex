Let $(a,b)$ be a lattice basis of a lattice $L$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Let $(a',b')$ be some other basis. Since they are bases, we must have that there are integers such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\na'&=\\alpha a +\\beta b \\\\\nb'&=\\gamma a +\\delta b\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhich can also be written in the matrix form\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n(a',b')=(a,b)P, \\qquad P=\\begin{pmatrix}\\alpha & \\gamma \\\\ \\beta & \\delta \\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNote that these $a',b',a,b$ are vectors, and so in fact $(a',b')$ and $(a,b)$ are matrices. \n \n Similarly, there is a matrix $Q$ with integers entries such that $(a,b)=(a',b')Q$. This gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n(a',b')&=(a,b)P=(a',b')QP \\\\\n(QP-I)(a',b')&=0\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNow, the matrix $(a',b')$ is composed of two linearly independent columns, and so has determinant $\\neq 0$. Multiplying by its inverse, we find that\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nQP-I&=0 \\\\\nQP &= 1 \\\\\n\\det(Q)\\det(P)=1\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSince $P,Q$ were matrices with integers entries, $\\det(P)$ must be an integer and since it divides $1$, we conclude that $\\det(P)=\\pm 1$. There are integer matrices $P,Q$ such that $(a',b')=(a,b)P$ and $(a,b)=(a',b')Q$. Then $(QP-I)(a',b')=0$ and so $QP=I$. Taking determinants, it follows that $\\det(P)=\\pm 1$.
