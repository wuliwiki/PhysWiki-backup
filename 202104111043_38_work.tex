\subsubsection{Solution Question 4:} 
\subsubsection{(4.1)} Obviously, if a solution is given, we only need to traverse each counter and check whether the color of the adjacent phase is consistent with it, and then the solution can be judged correct. It is an NP problem.
\subsubsection{(4.2)} In the speculation phase, use multiple formula times to generate two M top subsets of the vertex set. Previously, it was the solution of the problem. In the verification phase, use the deterministic algorithm of multiple formula times to verify the introduction of this subset. Whether the graph constitutes a Km complete graph, if yes, the answer is yes, otherwise the answer is whether there is a deterministic algorithm for multiple time, check and verify the previous one, therefore, the CliqueCover is a NP problem．
