\subsection{A.2 Measure Theory}

\begin{itemize}
\item Measure space $(X,\Omega,\mu)$. Integrable $\int_X \abs{\psi} \dd{\mu} < \infty$.

\item A measure $\mu$ on a measurable space $(X, \mu)$ is said to be $\sigma$-finite if $X$ can be written as a countable union of measurable sets of finite measure.
\end{itemize}
