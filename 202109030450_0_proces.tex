\subsection{Branching Process}
Branching process is the stochastic process also known as the process of birth and death. We usually consider the population start with one ancestor. It produces its own family
of offspring, and immediately dies. The born rule of the ancestor follows probability distribution $\{p_i\}_{i=0}^\infty$
