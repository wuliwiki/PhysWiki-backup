\subsection{A.2 Measure Theory}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Measure space} $(X,\Omega,\mu)$. \textbf{Integrable} $\int_X \abs{\psi} \dd{\mu} < \infty$.

\item \textbf{generated}

\item A measure $\mu$ on a measurable space $(X, \mu)$ is said to be \textbf{$\sigma$-finite} if $X$ can be written as a countable union of measurable sets of finite measure.

\item A.5 \textbf{absolutely continuous}

\item A.6 (\textbf{Radon-Nikodym}) Suppose $\mu$ and $\nu$ are two $\sigma$-finite measures on a measure space $(X, \Omega)$ and that $\mu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\nu$. Then there exists a non-negative, measurable function $\rho$ on $X$ such that $\mu(E)=\int_{E} \rho d \nu$, for all $E \in \Omega$. The function $\rho$ is called the \textbf{density} of $\mu$ with respect to $\nu$.
